 Flight Management Computer - Boeing 777 200-ER
 For Simulation Use Only

 This Flight Management Computer is for configuring the Boeing 777 200-ER for flight in X-Plane Mobile. 

 The program will calculate:

 Freeze Level (altitude)
 Takeoff Crosswind Component
 Cruise Crosswind Component
 Estimated Cruise Time
 Average Flight Speed
 Estimated Fuel
 Load
 Estimated Take-Off Weight
 Fuel Burn (ibs/hour)
 Optimal Cruise Altitude
 Climb N1 %
 Target Cruise N1
 Standard Air Temperature at Optimal Cruise Altitude
 True Air Temperature at Optimal Cruise Altitude
 Triptime
 Trip Fuel
 Contingency Fuel
 Alternate Fuel
 Reserve Fuel
 Total Fuel
 Take-Off Weight
 Estimated Remaining Fuel at Arrival Gate
 Optimal Center of Gravity
 Maximum Permissable Take-Off Weight
 Second Source Estimated Cruise Time
 Time Descending to Localizer
 Optimal Descent Feet Per Minute
 V1
 V2
 VR
 Flap Setting 
 Trim

 Note: Flights in X-Plane Mobile are always in ISA, therefore the FMC only takes these constant parameters into account.
